# Advanced Sarcasm Detection with Transformer Models

## Abstract
This repository is an extension of ongoing research into the detection of sarcasm using transformer-based models. This project explores the application of advanced deep learning techniques to enhance sarcasm detection across diverse textual datasets. Utilizing state-of-the-art models like BERT and RoBERTa, this study aims to refine the understanding and prediction of sarcasm, addressing the challenge posed by its subtle and context-dependent nature.

## Motivation
Sarcasm detection remains a challenging area in natural language processing due to its reliance on contextual cues and cultural nuances. Effective detection can significantly improve the interaction between humans and AI, particularly in fields like sentiment analysis and automated response systems.

## Models
### BERT
We employ the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model extensively in our experiments. BERT's ability to process words in relation to all other words in a sentence (rather than sequentially) allows it to capture the contextual nuances essential for accurate sarcasm detection.

### RoBERTa
In addition to BERT, we utilize RoBERTa, which modifies key hyperparameters in BERT, including removing the next-sentence pretraining objective and training with much larger mini-batches and learning rates.

## Data
The primary dataset used in this project is the Isarcasm dataset (Oprea and Magdy, 2019), which is designed specifically for sarcasm detection. We augment this with the Sarcasm Headlines Dataset (Misra and Arora, 2019) and the Sentiment140 dataset (Go et al., 2009) to enrich the training data and address the scarcity of sarcastic examples in existing collections.

## Data Augmentation
We enhance our dataset using generative models to increase the diversity and volume of training data. Specifically, we utilize GPT-2, a model known for its robust text generation capabilities. GPT-2 helps in creating varied sarcastic expressions, which are crucial for training our models to recognize sarcasm effectively. This directory contains scripts and models related to our data augmentation process using GPT-2.

## Experimental Setup

### Preprocessing Techniques
We explore a variety of preprocessing strategies to optimize model performance. These include tokenization, normalization, and noise reduction (e.g., removal of URLs and user mentions).

### Training
Models are fine-tuned on the augmented dataset using a cross-entropy loss function, optimized with Adam optimizer. Training configurations are meticulously documented to ensure reproducibility.

## Results


## Discussion
The results underscore the effectiveness of RoBERTa over BERT in sarcasm detection when trained under optimized conditions. Our findings suggest that tailored pre-training and larger mini-batches contribute significantly to performance improvements in detecting sarcasm.

## Conclusion and Future Work
This project highlights the potential of transformer-based models in understanding complex linguistic constructs like sarcasm. Future research will explore unsupervised learning techniques and the integration of multimodal data to further enhance sarcasm detection capabilities.
